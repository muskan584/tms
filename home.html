        <p>Everyone has some kind of liking for certain things in life. Hobby is something that people 
    enjoy doing for fun during their free time. Everyone must have a hobby to spend time on 
    something productive and to improve
    oneâ€™s physical and mental abilities. My hobby is a very good topic for the 
    class 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 students.</p>
